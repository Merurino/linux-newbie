#### Setting up linux for starters.

My goal with this is to help people who are trying to move from Windows/Mac to linux and don't know much about it (like me), so as I learn how to fix some stuff that's happening to me I'll add it here to make it easier for me and for others that may struggle with the same.

Check the source folder, as I'll be creating many smaller files for each specific scenario.

The `dev` folder just has some stuff (other tutos/repos) I found interesting so I've added it there to make it easier for me to search for it in the future.
