#### Arch is dimming my monitor during videos on Firefox.

In theory the app called `caffeine-ng` should fix this, but apparently it doesn't work with XFCE power manager.

I've installed a AUR package called `xfce4-power-manager-devel` that conflicts with the original `xfce4-power-manager` that I removed.

If something goes wrong, uninstall the devel one and re-install the original.
