#### Arch is dimming my monitor during videos on Firefox.

Right click on the power management icon (the battery icon).

Sometimes it may take up to 3 seconds to show the popup, when it shows, click on Presentation Mode, the power saving settings are not going to dim the monitor or let the computer sleep.
