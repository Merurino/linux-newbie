#### Recommended packages.
Recommended packages (I've used the AUR to get them on Arch/Manjaro) so I can search by name and install them

Check the file `arch-user-repo.md` before to make pacaur work on Arch.


##### General Desktop
- xflux-gui-git
- tomighty (Does not work very well, but works)

##### Development
- dotnet
- dotnet-cli
- dotnet-sdk
- visual-studio-core (check `arch-dotnet-core-debugger.md`)
